# Letters
After I made all the alphabet pop-ups, I felt like it's time to add some cool features to them. The first thing that came to my mind is adding LEDs to them, and light them up!
## What did I use
The letter pop-ups, copper foil tape of 1/4 inches, LEDs, and a soldering tool that used to connect LED and copper foil tape

I also built a power section, so I can test these pop-ups easier. For more information, please check the [Power](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/Light-up/tree/master/Power) folder.

## A: just keep it light on
For letter A, I started with a circuit that keeps the LED always light up. Once the positive and negative terminals are decided, it's actually easy to put the rest of the circuit onto the paper.

## B: light on when folding
For letter B, I made it to light on when folding, and light off when popping.
