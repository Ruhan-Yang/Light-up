# Power
In order to complete the circuit more easily, I built this power section. \
I used the same material as the alphabet pop-ups, with half the size, so it's a square when flat. \
Materials: 2 by 2 inches square cardstock, copper tape, a binder clip, and a button battery. 

This is how it looks like when it's flat

It had only the middle crease at first. For better contact, I also folded the corners later.

After folding, the battery will be fixed between the two layers of paper.
