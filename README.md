# Light-up
Let's light up the pop-ups! You can find all information here about building a simple circuit with pop-ups. \
There are four sections: \
The [Letters](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/Light-up/tree/master/Letters) section talks about building simple LED circuits on four letter pop-ups (A, B, C, and D).\
The [Power](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/Light-up/tree/master/Power) section talks about building a simple power unit for this circuit set.\
The [Push Botton](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/Light-up/tree/master/Push%20Botton) section and the [Switch](https://github.com/Ruhan-Yang/Light-up/tree/master/Switch) sections talk about the two operating units that can be added to the circuit.
