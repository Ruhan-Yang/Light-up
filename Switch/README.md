# Switch

## Initial release
As the switch will be connected with three sections at one time, it should be longer than other circuit sections, so I used the 2 by 4 inches cardstock at the beginning.

In the first test, I quickly realized that this design was not feasible. Two sections with LEDs need to be connected to the negative pole at the same time, so they are not lined up side by side.

## Revision A
In order to match the angular display, the switch section needs to be longer than the lengths of the two sections. I am using a 2 by 4.25 inches cardstock this time.
